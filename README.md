# D3 Dynamic Tree

This is an expansion of Mike Bostockâ€™s [Collapsible Tree Block](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083) that demonstrates how to dynamically add content to the tree as nodes are expanded. There is a working example of this tree [here](https://fhightower.github.io/d3-dynamic-tree/).
